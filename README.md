##Jordan Watkins is a web developer...

...with more than four years of professional experience.

Working at his standing desk in his Portland, OR home, he has created and worked on numerous websites many of which can be viewed via the [sites page](http://jordanjwatkins.github.io/portfolio-sites/).

Jordan is proficient with Photoshop and has designed full sites, but spends more of his time on the challenges of taking finished designs and coding them to look and work great in modern browsers and degrade gracefully in older ones.
